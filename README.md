📧 VBA Macro: CombineEmailAddresses
🔍 Purpose
This macro is designed to combine a fixed set of email addresses with a dynamic list of additional emails (provided in an Excel sheet). It outputs the full list of email addresses in a structured format, making it useful for preparing email distributions for reports, transmittals, or any bulk communications.

🧩 How It Works
A fixed list of emails is hardcoded into the macro.

Additional email addresses are retrieved from cell A2 of the EMAIL sheet.

The macro combines the two sets of emails:

If there are additional emails, they are appended to the fixed list.

If not, only the fixed list is used.

The final result is written into cell A3 on the same sheet.

📄 Example Output
If A2 contains:
extra.one@mail.com; extra.two@mail.net

Then A3 will show:
john.doe@example.com; sarah.connor@domain.test; michael.smith@company.org; anna.brown@samplemail.net; mark.jones@fakemail.co; lisa.taylor@nowhere.com; extra.one@mail.com; extra.two@mail.net


🧠 Use Case
Perfect for:

Preparing group email lists for Outlook.

Merging static recipients with custom ones for specific reports or notifications.

Document controllers or project admins who frequently handle transmittals or email routing.
